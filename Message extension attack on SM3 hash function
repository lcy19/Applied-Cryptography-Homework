First of all, I need to appreciate the teaching assistant, he gave me lots of help on ideas about cryptography. 
But I almost learned no thing about cryptography, I;m so sorry to admit that I still don't finish it.
I want to chang my mode of study. Before, I just wanted to use the provided function or lbrary to achieve my homework, 
but one of my friend told me last day, "You need to know details if yoou want to really understand it".
So, I am going to learn it as quikly as possible. 
ps: time is so limited.
